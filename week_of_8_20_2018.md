# Week of 8/20/2018

Coordinated with Infrastructure group lead on plans for the next quarter.

Responded for request for additional IPPP information.

Polished the e3sm_to_cmip driver scripts and handlers, created anaconda metadata information and published an 0.0.1 version to the e3sm anaconda channel. After testing found additional bugs/areas of improvement and iterated. By Tuesday I was pretty happy and was getting good results on all my tests, so started incorperating it into the processflow. As of Wednesday afternoon the CMOR job was working on all my manual tests. Pre and post run varification methods were able to tell when the job has passed or failed, the output was being created successfully, and logic has been added to the config varification process to check that valid input was being supplied by the user. Next step is to write some documentation and tests to go along with the code, and start the PR process.

Suppored user questions for processflow runs on acme1. After pointing them to the relavent documentation sections, they were able to finish a run with more then 30 jobs and no errors from the processflow.
