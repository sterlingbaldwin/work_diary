Found and identified an issue stopping the processflow from running correctly on rhea and anvil. Turns out the ssh library I use (paramiko) has an issue on some systems where it will get stuck in deadlock at import time.
This was a particularly thorny issue to deal with as nothing I could do would stop it, and it would get stuck during the import step and never finish. I did a short-term resolve of this by changing the filemanager to dynamically load
the transport interface requested by the user in the config, so the libraries will only be loaded if the user requests ssh file transport. The upside of this is that the import step is now much faster in some configurations, since
globus was one of the slowest to load modules.

Responded to IPPP personel feedback requests.

Discovered that sometimes, some jobs would fail on anvil. Very confusingly the error given would be that the job couldnt access my home directory, even though nothing in the run script or any of the jobs commands touched my home directory, or did anything outside of the bulk storage area. Contacted LCRC support, and was informed that all jobs create temporary out/error log files in the users home directory, even when the log/error flags have been explicitly set to go somewhere else. The logs are just moved to the requested location after the jobs finishes. They commented that the -D flag to change the jobs running directory can sometimes cause undefined behavior and suggested I remove it. Editorial: slurm is such a rediculusly better job scheduler then PBS it astonishes me when I come across computing centers that still use it.
