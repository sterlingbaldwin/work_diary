Found and identified an issue stopping the processflow from running correctly on rhea and anvil. Turns out the ssh library I use (paramiko) has an issue on some systems where it will get stuck in deadlock at import time.
This was a particularly thorny issue to deal with as nothing I could do would stop it, and it would get stuck during the import step and never finish. I did a short-term resolve of this by changing the filemanager to dynamically load
the transport interface requested by the user in the config, so the libraries will only be loaded if the user requests ssh file transport. The upside of this is that the import step is now much faster in some configurations, since
globus was one of the slowest to load modules.

Responded to IPPP personel feedback requests.
